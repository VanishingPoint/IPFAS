# IPFAS
Repository for code relating to an Intellegent Personal Fall Arrest System

This code was for a course project at the University of British Columbia in 2023.

Git was not used during the course of development, and the files here were added after development concluded. All code is in the form of .ino files written in C using the
Arduino IDE and intended for use on the Arduino Nano 33 IoT or the ESP32 WROOM.

"Test Code For Rope" represents the final revision of the Arduino code at the end of the project, while the code labelled with the anchor numbers and tag are for the
respective UWB components.

The "Wifi Only" code represents code used on an ESP32 WROOM that was used to replace one of the UWB anchors.

All other files should be self-explanitory.
